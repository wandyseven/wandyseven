### Hi, I’m Wandy 👋

I’m a creative frontend developer with a senior design background.

I build interactive web experiences using **Next.js**, **React** and **React Three Fiber (R3F)**.  
Before writing code, I spent several years as a **digital / visual designer**, working on branding, UI/UX and motion.

- 🔭 Current focus: **3D web, creative frontends, portfolio & experimental projects**
- 💡 Strength: I combine **design thinking** with **clean, maintainable code**
- 🌍 Open to remote / hybrid roles and collaborations on creative web projects
- 🎨 Tools I love: Figma, After Effects, Blender (beginner), Procreate
